# ShutTheBoxiOS

Source for the iOS implementation of the traditional Shut The Box game.

Originally was a Xamarin.iOS app, converted to .Net MAUI, intended to present numbers facts.

Leveraged numbersapi.com which no longer exists. Have temporarily removed this core feature in the MAUI variant.

App was at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shut-the-box-fun/id980997000?ls=1&mt=8 from about 2015 to 2020.

Kept only as a demo now.

Run in simulator:

dotnet build -t:Run -f net10.0-ios
